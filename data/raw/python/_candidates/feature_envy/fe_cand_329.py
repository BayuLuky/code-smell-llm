    The relation declaration is a line with the format ``@RELATION
    <relation-name>``, where ``relation-name`` is a string. The string must
    start with alphabetic character and must be quoted if the name includes
    spaces, otherwise this method will raise a `BadRelationFormat` exception.

    This method must receive a normalized string, i.e., a string without
    padding, including the "\r\n" characters.

    :param s: a normalized string.
    :return: a string with the decoded relation name.
