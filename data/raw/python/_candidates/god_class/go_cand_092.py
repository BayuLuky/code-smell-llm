class HistGradientBoostingClassifier(ClassifierMixin, BaseHistGradientBoosting):
    """Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Classification Tree.

    This estimator is much faster than
    :class:`GradientBoostingClassifier<sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier>`
    for big datasets (n_samples >= 10 000).

    This estimator has native support for missing values (NaNs). During
    training, the tree grower learns at each split point whether samples
    with missing values should go to the left or right child, based on the
    potential gain. When predicting, samples with missing values are
    assigned to the left or right child consequently. If no missing values
    were encountered for a given feature during training, then samples with
    missing values are mapped to whichever child has the most samples.

    This implementation is inspired by
    `LightGBM <https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : {'log_loss'}, default='log_loss'
        The loss function to use in the boosting process.

        For binary classification problems, 'log_loss' is also known as logistic loss,
        binomial deviance or binary crossentropy. Internally, the model fits one tree
        per boosting iteration and uses the logistic sigmoid function (expit) as
        inverse link function to compute the predicted positive class probability.

        For multiclass classification problems, 'log_loss' is also known as multinomial
        deviance or categorical crossentropy. Internally, the model fits one tree per
        boosting iteration and per class and uses the softmax function as inverse link
        function to compute the predicted probabilities of the classes.

    learning_rate : float, default=0.1
        The learning rate, also known as *shrinkage*. This is used as a
        multiplicative factor for the leaves values. Use ``1`` for no
        shrinkage.
    max_iter : int, default=100
        The maximum number of iterations of the boosting process, i.e. the
        maximum number of trees for binary classification. For multiclass
        classification, `n_classes` trees per iteration are built.
    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, default=31
        The maximum number of leaves for each tree. Must be strictly greater
        than 1. If None, there is no maximum limit.
    max_depth : int or None, default=None
        The maximum depth of each tree. The depth of a tree is the number of
        edges to go from the root to the deepest leaf.
        Depth isn't constrained by default.
    min_samples_leaf : int, default=20
        The minimum number of samples per leaf. For small datasets with less
        than a few hundred samples, it is recommended to lower this value
        since only very shallow trees would be built.
    l2_regularization : float, default=0
        The L2 regularization parameter. Use ``0`` for no regularization (default).
    max_features : float, default=1.0
        Proportion of randomly chosen features in each and every node split.
        This is a form of regularization, smaller values make the trees weaker
        learners and might prevent overfitting.
        If interaction constraints from `interaction_cst` are present, only allowed
        features are taken into account for the subsampling.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    max_bins : int, default=255
        The maximum number of bins to use for non-missing values. Before
        training, each feature of the input array `X` is binned into
        integer-valued bins, which allows for a much faster training stage.
        Features with a small number of unique values may use less than
        ``max_bins`` bins. In addition to the ``max_bins`` bins, one more bin
        is always reserved for missing values. Must be no larger than 255.
    categorical_features : array-like of {bool, int, str} of shape (n_features) \
            or shape (n_categorical_features,), default=None
        Indicates the categorical features.

        - None : no feature will be considered categorical.
        - boolean array-like : boolean mask indicating categorical features.
        - integer array-like : integer indices indicating categorical
          features.
        - str array-like: names of categorical features (assuming the training
          data has feature names).
        - `"from_dtype"`: dataframe columns with dtype "category" are
          considered to be categorical features. The input must be an object
          exposing a ``__dataframe__`` method such as pandas or polars
          DataFrames to use this feature.

        For each categorical feature, there must be at most `max_bins` unique
        categories. Negative values for categorical features encoded as numeric
        dtypes are treated as missing values. All categorical values are
        converted to floating point numbers. This means that categorical values
        of 1.0 and 1 are treated as the same category.

        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <categorical_support_gbdt>`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2
           Added support for feature names.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.4
           Added `"from_dtype"` option. The default will change to `"from_dtype"` in
           v1.6.

    monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features) or dict, default=None
        Monotonic constraint to enforce on each feature are specified using the
        following integer values:

        - 1: monotonic increase
        - 0: no constraint
        - -1: monotonic decrease

        If a dict with str keys, map feature to monotonic constraints by name.
        If an array, the features are mapped to constraints by position. See
        :ref:`monotonic_cst_features_names` for a usage example.

        The constraints are only valid for binary classifications and hold
        over the probability of the positive class.
        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <monotonic_cst_gbdt>`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2
           Accept dict of constraints with feature names as keys.

    interaction_cst : {"pairwise", "no_interactions"} or sequence of lists/tuples/sets \
            of int, default=None
        Specify interaction constraints, the sets of features which can
        interact with each other in child node splits.

        Each item specifies the set of feature indices that are allowed
        to interact with each other. If there are more features than
        specified in these constraints, they are treated as if they were
        specified as an additional set.

        The strings "pairwise" and "no_interactions" are shorthands for
        allowing only pairwise or no interactions, respectively.

        For instance, with 5 features in total, `interaction_cst=[{0, 1}]`
        is equivalent to `interaction_cst=[{0, 1}, {2, 3, 4}]`,
        and specifies that each branch of a tree will either only split
        on features 0 and 1 or only split on features 2, 3 and 4.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble. For results to be valid, the
        estimator should be re-trained on the same data only.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
    early_stopping : 'auto' or bool, default='auto'
        If 'auto', early stopping is enabled if the sample size is larger than
        10000. If True, early stopping is enabled, otherwise early stopping is
        disabled.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23

    scoring : str or callable or None, default='loss'
        Scoring parameter to use for early stopping. It can be a single
        string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable (see
        :ref:`scoring`). If None, the estimator's default scorer
        is used. If ``scoring='loss'``, early stopping is checked
        w.r.t the loss value. Only used if early stopping is performed.
    validation_fraction : int or float or None, default=0.1
        Proportion (or absolute size) of training data to set aside as
        validation data for early stopping. If None, early stopping is done on
        the training data. Only used if early stopping is performed.
    n_iter_no_change : int, default=10
        Used to determine when to "early stop". The fitting process is
        stopped when none of the last ``n_iter_no_change`` scores are better
        than the ``n_iter_no_change - 1`` -th-to-last one, up to some
        tolerance. Only used if early stopping is performed.
    tol : float, default=1e-7
        The absolute tolerance to use when comparing scores. The higher the
        tolerance, the more likely we are to early stop: higher tolerance
        means that it will be harder for subsequent iterations to be
        considered an improvement upon the reference score.
    verbose : int, default=0
        The verbosity level. If not zero, print some information about the
        fitting process.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Pseudo-random number generator to control the subsampling in the
        binning process, and the train/validation data split if early stopping
        is enabled.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default=None
        Weights associated with classes in the form `{class_label: weight}`.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.
        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as `n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))`.
        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if `sample_weight` is specified.
