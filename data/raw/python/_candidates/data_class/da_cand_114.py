class OAS(EmpiricalCovariance):
    """Oracle Approximating Shrinkage Estimator as proposed in [1]_.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <shrunk_covariance>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    store_precision : bool, default=True
        Specify if the estimated precision is stored.

    assume_centered : bool, default=False
        If True, data will not be centered before computation.
        Useful when working with data whose mean is almost, but not exactly
        zero.
        If False (default), data will be centered before computation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    covariance_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_features)
        Estimated covariance matrix.

    location_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Estimated location, i.e. the estimated mean.

    precision_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_features)
        Estimated pseudo inverse matrix.
        (stored only if store_precision is True)

    shrinkage_ : float
      coefficient in the convex combination used for the computation
      of the shrunk estimate. Range is [0, 1].

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    Notes
    -----
    The regularised covariance is:

    (1 - shrinkage) * cov + shrinkage * mu * np.identity(n_features),

    where mu = trace(cov) / n_features and shrinkage is given by the OAS formula
    (see [1]_).

    The shrinkage formulation implemented here differs from Eq. 23 in [1]_. In
    the original article, formula (23) states that 2/p (p being the number of
    features) is multiplied by Trace(cov*cov) in both the numerator and
    denominator, but this operation is omitted because for a large p, the value
    of 2/p is so small that it doesn't affect the value of the estimator.
