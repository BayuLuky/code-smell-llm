        Return the indices and distances of each point from the dataset
        lying in a ball with size ``radius`` around the points of the query
        array. Points lying on the boundary are included in the results.

        The result points are *not* necessarily sorted by distance to their

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of (n_samples, n_features), default=None
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        radius : float, default=None
            Limiting distance of neighbors to return. The default is the value

        return_distance : bool, default=True
            Whether or not to return the distances.

        sort_results : bool, default=False
            If True, the distances and indices will be sorted by increasing

            be sorted. If `return_distance=False`, setting `sort_results=True`
            will result in an error.

            .. versionadded:: 0.22

        Returns
        -------
        neigh_dist : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) of arrays
            Array representing the distances to each point, only present if
            `return_distance=True`. The distance values are computed according
            to the ``metric`` constructor parameter.

        neigh_ind : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) of arrays
            An array of arrays of indices of the approximate nearest points
            from the population matrix that lie within a ball of size
            ``radius`` around the query points.

        Notes
        -----
        Because the number of neighbors of each point is not necessarily
        equal, the results for multiple query points cannot be fit in a
        standard data array.
        For efficiency, `radius_neighbors` returns arrays of objects, where
        each object is a 1D array of indices or distances.

        Examples
        --------
        In the following example, we construct a NeighborsClassifier
        class from an array representing our data set and ask who's
        the closest point to [1, 1, 1]:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> samples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]
        >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
        >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(radius=1.6)
        >>> neigh.fit(samples)
        NearestNeighbors(radius=1.6)
        >>> rng = neigh.radius_neighbors([[1., 1., 1.]])
        >>> print(np.asarray(rng[0][0]))
        [1.5 0.5]
        >>> print(np.asarray(rng[1][0]))
        [1 2]

        The first array returned contains the distances to all points which
        are closer than 1.6, while the second array returned contains their
        indices.  In general, multiple points can be queried at the same time.
