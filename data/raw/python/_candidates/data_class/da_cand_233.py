class FeatureAgglomeration(

):
    """Agglomerate features.

    Recursively merges pair of clusters of features.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <hierarchical_clustering>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int or None, default=2
        The number of clusters to find. It must be ``None`` if
        ``distance_threshold`` is not ``None``.

    metric : str or callable, default="euclidean"
        Metric used to compute the linkage. Can be "euclidean", "l1", "l2",
        "manhattan", "cosine", or "precomputed". If linkage is "ward", only
        "euclidean" is accepted. If "precomputed", a distance matrix is needed
        as input for the fit method.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

        .. deprecated:: 1.4
           `metric=None` is deprecated in 1.4 and will be removed in 1.6.
           Let `metric` be the default value (i.e. `"euclidean"`) instead.

    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None
        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.
        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the
        path to the caching directory.

    connectivity : array-like or callable, default=None
        Connectivity matrix. Defines for each feature the neighboring
        features following a given structure of the data.
        This can be a connectivity matrix itself or a callable that transforms
        the data into a connectivity matrix, such as derived from
        `kneighbors_graph`. Default is `None`, i.e, the
        hierarchical clustering algorithm is unstructured.

    compute_full_tree : 'auto' or bool, default='auto'
        Stop early the construction of the tree at `n_clusters`. This is useful
        to decrease computation time if the number of clusters is not small
        compared to the number of features. This option is useful only when
        specifying a connectivity matrix. Note also that when varying the
        number of clusters and using caching, it may be advantageous to compute
        the full tree. It must be ``True`` if ``distance_threshold`` is not
        ``None``. By default `compute_full_tree` is "auto", which is equivalent
        to `True` when `distance_threshold` is not `None` or that `n_clusters`
        is inferior to the maximum between 100 or `0.02 * n_samples`.
        Otherwise, "auto" is equivalent to `False`.

    linkage : {"ward", "complete", "average", "single"}, default="ward"
        Which linkage criterion to use. The linkage criterion determines which
        distance to use between sets of features. The algorithm will merge
        the pairs of cluster that minimize this criterion.

        - "ward" minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged.
        - "complete" or maximum linkage uses the maximum distances between
          all features of the two sets.
        - "average" uses the average of the distances of each feature of
          the two sets.
        - "single" uses the minimum of the distances between all features
          of the two sets.

    pooling_func : callable, default=np.mean
        This combines the values of agglomerated features into a single
        value, and should accept an array of shape [M, N] and the keyword
        argument `axis=1`, and reduce it to an array of size [M].

    distance_threshold : float, default=None
        The linkage distance threshold at or above which clusters will not be
        merged. If not ``None``, ``n_clusters`` must be ``None`` and
        ``compute_full_tree`` must be ``True``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.21

    compute_distances : bool, default=False
        Computes distances between clusters even if `distance_threshold` is not
        used. This can be used to make dendrogram visualization, but introduces
        a computational and memory overhead.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_clusters_ : int
        The number of clusters found by the algorithm. If
        ``distance_threshold=None``, it will be equal to the given
        ``n_clusters``.

    labels_ : array-like of (n_features,)
        Cluster labels for each feature.

    n_leaves_ : int
        Number of leaves in the hierarchical tree.

    n_connected_components_ : int
        The estimated number of connected components in the graph.

        .. versionadded:: 0.21
            ``n_connected_components_`` was added to replace ``n_components_``.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    children_ : array-like of shape (n_nodes-1, 2)
        The children of each non-leaf node. Values less than `n_features`
        correspond to leaves of the tree which are the original samples.
        A node `i` greater than or equal to `n_features` is a non-leaf
        node and has children `children_[i - n_features]`. Alternatively
        at the i-th iteration, children[i][0] and children[i][1]
        are merged to form node `n_features + i`.

    distances_ : array-like of shape (n_nodes-1,)
        Distances between nodes in the corresponding place in `children_`.
        Only computed if `distance_threshold` is used or `compute_distances`
        is set to `True`.
