    The "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" policy specifies that a full URL,
    stripped for use as a referrer, is sent as referrer information
    when making same-origin requests from a particular request client,
    and only the ASCII serialization of the origin of the request client
    when making cross-origin requests:

    - from a TLS-protected environment settings object to a potentially trustworthy URL, and
    - from non-TLS-protected environment settings objects to any origin.

    Requests from TLS-protected clients to non- potentially trustworthy URLs,
    on the other hand, will contain no referrer information.
    A Referer HTTP header will not be sent.
