class LassoLarsCV(LarsCV):
    """Cross-validated Lasso, using the LARS algorithm.

    See glossary entry for :term:`cross-validation estimator`.

    The optimization objective for Lasso is::

    (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <least_angle_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

    verbose : bool or int, default=False
        Sets the verbosity amount.

    max_iter : int, default=500
        Maximum number of iterations to perform.

    precompute : bool or 'auto' , default='auto'
        Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up
        calculations. If set to ``'auto'`` let us decide. The Gram matrix
        cannot be passed as argument since we will use only subsets of X.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    max_n_alphas : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of points on the path used to compute the
        residuals in the cross-validation.

    n_jobs : int or None, default=None
        Number of CPUs to use during the cross validation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    eps : float, default=np.finfo(float).eps
        The machine-precision regularization in the computation of the
        Cholesky diagonal factors. Increase this for very ill-conditioned
        systems. Unlike the ``tol`` parameter in some iterative
        optimization-based algorithms, this parameter does not control
        the tolerance of the optimization.

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    positive : bool, default=False
        Restrict coefficients to be >= 0. Be aware that you might want to
        remove fit_intercept which is set True by default.
        Under the positive restriction the model coefficients do not converge
        to the ordinary-least-squares solution for small values of alpha.
        Only coefficients up to the smallest alpha value (``alphas_[alphas_ >
        0.].min()`` when fit_path=True) reached by the stepwise Lars-Lasso
        algorithm are typically in congruence with the solution of the
        coordinate descent Lasso estimator.
        As a consequence using LassoLarsCV only makes sense for problems where
        a sparse solution is expected and/or reached.

        has feature names that are all strings.

    Notes
    -----
    The object solves the same problem as the
    :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV` object. However, unlike the
    :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV`, it find the relevant alphas values
    by itself. In general, because of this property, it will be more stable.
    However, it is more fragile to heavily multicollinear datasets.

    It is more efficient than the :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV` if
    only a small number of features are selected compared to the total number,
    for instance if there are very few samples compared to the number of
    features.

    In `fit`, once the best parameter `alpha` is found through
    cross-validation, the model is fit again using the entire training set.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LassoLarsCV
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    >>> X, y = make_regression(noise=4.0, random_state=0)
    >>> reg = LassoLarsCV(cv=5).fit(X, y)
    >>> reg.score(X, y)
    0.9993...
    >>> reg.alpha_
    0.3972...
    >>> reg.predict(X[:1,])
    array([-78.4831...])
