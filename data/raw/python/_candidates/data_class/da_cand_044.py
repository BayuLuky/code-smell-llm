class MultiTaskLasso(MultiTaskElasticNet):
    """Multi-task Lasso model trained with L1/L2 mixed-norm as regularizer.

    The optimization objective for Lasso is::

        (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||Y - XW||^2_Fro + alpha * ||W||_21

    Where::

        ||W||_21 = \\sum_i \\sqrt{\\sum_j w_{ij}^2}

    i.e. the sum of norm of each row.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <multi_task_lasso>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, default=1.0
        Constant that multiplies the L1/L2 term. Defaults to 1.0.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If ``True``, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    max_iter : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of iterations.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are
        smaller than ``tol``, the optimization code checks the
        dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller
        than ``tol``.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects a random
        feature to update. Used when ``selection`` == 'random'.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    selection : {'cyclic', 'random'}, default='cyclic'
        If set to 'random', a random coefficient is updated every iteration
        rather than looping over features sequentially by default. This
        (setting to 'random') often leads to significantly faster convergence
        especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_targets, n_features)
        Parameter vector (W in the cost function formula).
        Note that ``coef_`` stores the transpose of ``W``, ``W.T``.

    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (n_targets,)
        Independent term in decision function.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations run by the coordinate descent solver to reach
        the specified tolerance.

    dual_gap_ : ndarray of shape (n_alphas,)
        The dual gaps at the end of the optimization for each alpha.

    eps_ : float
        The tolerance scaled scaled by the variance of the target `y`.

    sparse_coef_ : sparse matrix of shape (n_features,) or \
            (n_targets, n_features)
        Sparse representation of the `coef_`.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm used to fit the model is coordinate descent.

    To avoid unnecessary memory duplication the X and y arguments of the fit
    method should be directly passed as Fortran-contiguous numpy arrays.
