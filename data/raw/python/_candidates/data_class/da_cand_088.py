class LedoitWolf(EmpiricalCovariance):
    """LedoitWolf Estimator.

    Ledoit-Wolf is a particular form of shrinkage, where the shrinkage
    coefficient is computed using O. Ledoit and M. Wolf's formula as
    described in "A Well-Conditioned Estimator for Large-Dimensional
    Covariance Matrices", Ledoit and Wolf, Journal of Multivariate
    Analysis, Volume 88, Issue 2, February 2004, pages 365-411.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <shrunk_covariance>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    store_precision : bool, default=True
        Specify if the estimated precision is stored.

    assume_centered : bool, default=False
        If True, data will not be centered before computation.
        Useful when working with data whose mean is almost, but not exactly
        zero.
        If False (default), data will be centered before computation.

    block_size : int, default=1000
        Size of blocks into which the covariance matrix will be split
        during its Ledoit-Wolf estimation. This is purely a memory
        optimization and does not affect results.

    Attributes
    ----------
    covariance_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_features)
        Estimated covariance matrix.

    location_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Estimated location, i.e. the estimated mean.

    precision_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_features)
        Estimated pseudo inverse matrix.
        (stored only if store_precision is True)

    shrinkage_ : float
        Coefficient in the convex combination used for the computation
        of the shrunk estimate. Range is [0, 1].

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    Notes
    -----
    The regularised covariance is:

    (1 - shrinkage) * cov + shrinkage * mu * np.identity(n_features)

    where mu = trace(cov) / n_features
    and shrinkage is given by the Ledoit and Wolf formula (see References)
